        <P>
          Hi, I'm Natalia Sierra. I'm 20 years old and currently studying programming. When I started, I had no idea
          what I was getting into since I had no prior knowledge, and fear overwhelmed me. However, I have been learning
          gradually, and I've started to like it. I've decided that I want to focus on frontend development.
          <br><br><br>

      <p>
        I am currently enrolled in the Software Analysis and Development program at SENA, which lasts two years and
        provides training in programming, databases, systems analysis, and the development of web and mobile
        applications.
        Throughout the course, I have gained competencies in various technologies and learned to use web technologies
        and
        databases. The program includes business internships, allowing me to apply my knowledge in real-world
        environments
        and preparing me to obtain the title of Technologist in Software Analysis and Development.
